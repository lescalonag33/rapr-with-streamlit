- READMEs that end with _ (i.e. `README_`) are the ones which should be created in the exact places during specialization/course development as well.
- Plain `README` files (without underscore) just contains explanations about this standard template. They can be deleted after the initial commit. 


# Specialization README

- The specialization name should be in lower case and with hyphen(s) (**without spaces**). 
      
      E.g
      - deep-learning
      - ai-for-medicine

- Within the specialization folder, along with the course folders should be a README file in which we mention the specialization name. 
    - In case we decide to change the name of the specialization during development we would only have to change it in the README, this way we won't disrupt the course specialization/course repository.
- This README will also contain further necessary details about the specialization, if any.
